# HOA_FinancialDashboard
I am the Budget & Finance Committee Chair for my homeowners association. I produce this financial dashboard monthly for the Board of Directors to review. I used Excel to allow for seamless transferring of my responsibilities at any time to an individual whose knowledgebase doesn't extend beyond MS Office. Optimized for B&amp;W printing.
Functions utilized: INDIRECT(), INDEX(), MATCH(), SUMIFS()
